This is an implementation of a circular linked list data structure. This library allows users to create and manipulate circular linked lists with ease, supporting operations like insertion, reversal, and printing in both ascending and descending orders.

Features
Construction and Copy: Support for default construction, copy construction, and copy assignment.
Order Management: Allows for insertion of elements in ascending or descending order.
Insertion: Insert elements in an ordered fashion based on the current list order.
Reversal: Reverse the order of the list from ascending to descending or vice versa.
Push Back: Add elements to the end of the list.
Print: Print the contents of the list along with node addresses.
Stream Overload: Overload the << operator for easy printing of the list contents.
